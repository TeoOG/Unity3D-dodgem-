# DODGEM

This is not a game , in the traditional sense , meaning there is not an end goal . That's cause it was done for the purpose of a school project . Neverthanless , it demonstrates many game tropes , such as camera and player movement , spawning random objects and moving/applying texture on an object (that is a sphere , in thsi particular game) .
